# passport-style-photo-cropper
Automatically detects and crops a face from an image to generate a passport-style photo from uploaded image. Ensures correct orientation, centers the face, and optionally compresses the image to stay within a specified file size (e.g., under 100KB). Ideal for scanned documents, selfies, or batch passport photo generation.
